# 📒 Notes App

A RESTful Notes Application built using **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **MongoDB** — designed for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes with a clean API and optional frontend support.

This project provides a scalable backend service to manage notes (text content) via a modern FastAPI server and stores the data in a MongoDB database. FastAPI makes the API fast and easy to document with built-in OpenAPI support.

## 🧠 **Project Description**

The Notes App is a simple but powerful API for managing notes. Users can add new notes, read existing ones, update them, or delete unwanted entries. The RESTful design makes it ideal for use with frontend clients (web, mobile, or others), and the API documentation is auto-generated by FastAPI.

Features include:

- 📝 Create rich text notes
- 🔎 Retrieve all or individual notes
- ✏️ Update notes
- ❌ Delete notes
- 📄 Interactive API docs via Swagger UI

This backend can also be extended with user authentication, frontend integration, search, pagination, tagging, and more.
